      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="3">Design 3: Medium headings without underline link and 5 pixel bottom border</h2>
      <p>This design shows the same heading size as design two but without an underline. As these cards are used widely in the interface, we considered whether users might be able to learn that the blue headings are links even though they're not underlined (<a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/typography/#links-without-underlines">see GOV.UK guidance on links without underlines</a>). However, as a design team, we worried that in the context of cards, it may not be obvious enough to some users that the headings are links and that design 2 is more obvious.</p>
